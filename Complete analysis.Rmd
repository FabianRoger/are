In this document we describe the complete data analysis for the article **Roger et al (YEAR)**
In order to ensure reproducability, we use the package "checkpoint"

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#install.packages("checkpoint")
#library(checkpoint)
```

#Bacterial Cell counts

in this section we 

+ import the raw data as gated by the flow-cytometer
+ clean and bias-correct the counts
+ plot the growth curves
+ calculate maximum cell counts to be used in further analysis
