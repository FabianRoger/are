In this document we describe step 1 of the data analysis for the article **Roger et al (YEAR)**
In order to ensure reproducability, we use the package "checkpoint"

This is the first out of X documents.  

__this script needs:__ 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
list.files("FlowCytoDocs")
```
  
__this script does:__

  + quality control 
  + bias correction
  + calculates maximum biomass per sample
  + calculates temporal stability


__this script exports:__
  
  + maxBM.txt; table with maximum cell counts
  + Stability.txt; a table with temporal stability of the cell counts
  + Fig_S2.pdf; the graph of the grwoth curves for all communities, by dilution and colour coded by Lake

the Gating:

[extract from my labbook]

> I re-gate the data, based on a dot plot, a density plot showing 95% of the dots and 2 3D histograms. The aim is to gate everything besides the cluster in the lower left corner that is unlikely to be bacteria but some kind of “trash” (or viruses?) . I will change the gate as little as possible. [...] The Batch count is done [...] with a file increament of 48, hence counting one Bottle chronologically at the time (to be consistent with the gating within one bottle). The Stats are exported in “Bac Counts DivTox 2nd counting”.
  
![I want a freeking captaion](FlowCytoDocs/flowcyto_example_gate.png)  
example of the flow cyto gating. The upper graph shows the dot plot and the lower graph the density plot

first, we import the afformentioned file, clean it and have a look at it

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Bac <- read.table("FlowCytoDocs/Bac Counts DivTox 2nd counting.txt", header=T, sep="\t")

# keep and rename only necessary columns
Bac <- Bac[ , c( "File.Name", "Acquisition.Date", "Label", "Events" )]
colnames( Bac ) <- c( "FileN", "Acq.Date", "Gate", "Ev")

### transpose data.frame ###
BacT <- melt( Bac, id = c( "FileN", "Acq.Date", "Gate"))
Bac <- dcast(BacT, ... ~ Gate)
head(Bac, 2)

```

The `$Gate` column of the file contains two gates, Gate __G1__ correspond to region 
__R1__ in the in the picture above and gates the beads that were added as internal standard

The Gate __G2__ correspond to region __R2__ and gates the bacterial cells

+ I split up the information contained in the `$FileN` colum into three new columns
    + `$SO` is the sampling occasion ( 01 - 21) 
    + `$DAT` is the sampling date (02/06 to 12/07)
    + `$BOT` is the number of the bottle that was sampled (01 - 48)
+ I add a lake column `$Lake` to group the bottles into the respective lakes
+ I add a column with the dilution factor for each bottle (`$DIL`)  

The dilution factor represent the exponent of the dilution. Each dilution step was \~ 1 : 4.5. 
So the 10^th^ dilution would be a 1 : 4.5^10^ dilution and the dilution factor
would be 10.  
The experiment had 10 dilution factors (0 - 10), and a sterile controle. As
the sterile controle got invaded by (assumingly) environmental bacteria, we included it
as treatment.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# splitting the columns
Bac$SO <- substr( Bac[,1],1,2)
Bac$DAT <- substr( Bac[,1],4,8)
Bac$BOT <- substr( Bac[,1],10,11)

# adding Lake column
b <- as.character( formatC( c( 1:48), width=2, flag=0))

Bac$Lake[ Bac$BOT %in% b[ 1:12] ]  <-  "Surtesjön"
Bac$Lake[ Bac$BOT %in% b[ 13:24]]  <-  "Delsjön"
Bac$Lake[ Bac$BOT %in% b[ 25:36]]  <-  "Lerum"
Bac$Lake[ Bac$BOT %in% b[ 37:48]]  <-  "Botan"

#adding DIL column
n <- c( rep( c( 0, formatC( c( 1:10), width=2, flag=0), "S"), 4))

for ( i in 1:48){
  Bac$DIL[ Bac$BOT == b[ i]] <-  n[ i] }

```
```{r}
head(Bac[ , -1], 2)
```


##checking the beads

we added 50µl of 1µm fluorescent beads solution with a known concentration into 
each sample as internal standard. The bead solution was sonnicated thorowly at the beginning
of each day and between each batch. However, the beads might have aggregated during the day or, to the contrary, aggregates that formed over night might have been broken up more and more during subsequent sonications. Both effect potentially
biased the cell counts. To determine the concentration of the bead solution at the beginning of the day and after every second
batch, we counted the beads with an absolute standard, BD Trucount^TM^ Tubes, containing exactly 52187 beads. 

In the following section, we used the exact timestemp of each raw flow cytometry file to asses biases over a day.  


```{r, include=FALSE}
# load time stamp File
FileT <- read.table( "FlowCytoDocs/FileT.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")

#add the time stamp of each file to the Bac
Bac <- join(Bac, FileT)

#replace Acq.Date with Date from Timestemp and replace ctim with time from
#timestemp
Bac$Acq.Date <- substr( Bac$ctim, 1, 10)
Bac$ctim <- substr( Bac$ctim, 11, 19)

#transform to POSIXct
Bac$ctim <- as.POSIXct( strptime( Bac$ctim, "%H:%M:%S"))

# I always read 24 samples in 1 rack. to visualise the racks in the
# graph I add column "Rack" where bottle N 01-24 are assigen "a"
# and bottle N 25-48 are assigned "b". I order the dataframe by aquisition date and
# time and subsequnetly add a column alternating  24 x "a" and 24 x "b", 21 times 
# (= number of racks in total)

Bac <- Bac[with(Bac, order(Acq.Date, ctim)),]
Bac$Rack <- rep( c( rep( "a", 24), rep( "b", 24)), 21)
```

to visually check for biases, i plot the bead counts of each file against it's
aquisition time, split by aquisition day. To visualize the batches, we alternate
the colours every 24 samples ( = the size of 1 batch )

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
ggplot( Bac,  aes( x = ctim, y = G1, colour = Rack)) +
  geom_point( size = 1) +
  facet_wrap( ~Acq.Date, scales  =  "free_x") +
  geom_smooth( method  =  "lm",  se = TRUE,  color = "black",  formula  =  y ~ x)+
  labs( title  = "Bead concentration over time, by day",
        y = "Beads",
        x = "aquisition time of sample")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")
```
  

Looking at the graph above, it looks like the bead counts goe up over the course of 
a day. While it is normal that the flowrate of the flow-cytometer varies randomly (as can be seen
by the spread of the bead counts within each batch), the increase of the bead counts over the course of a day
indicates that __concentration__ of the bead solution changed. We have the BD Trucount^TM^ counts to correct for
this bias:  

  
   
```{r, include = F}
# The Truecounts are in two different files
# the first files are only the TC form the 2013-09-10 that were
# counted on high flow. They corrspond to the Bac counts 06/14 1-24. 
# the second files are all the other TC

TrueC <- read.table( "FlowCytoDocs/main Exp True Count Stats2.txt",  header = T,  sep = "\t")
TrueC2 <- read.table( "FlowCytoDocs/TC 0614 HF2.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)

#keep only relevant columns
TrueC <- TrueC[ , c("File.Name", "Sample.ID", "Acquisition.Date", "Label", "Events")]
TrueC2 <- TrueC2[ , c("File.Name", "Sample.ID", "Acquisition.Date", "Label", "Events")]

#dataframes are merged and all the TC from True2 are kept
TrueC <- rbind( TrueC, TrueC2)

#transpose dataframes
TrueCTm <- melt( TrueC, measure.vars = "Events")
TrueC <- dcast( TrueCTm, ...~Label)

#add absolute count column (each Trucount tube contains exactly 52187 beads)
TrueC$TC <- 52187

#calculate bead C ( BeadC) in the tube with G1 and G2 ( ( TC/G2)*G1)
# G1 and G3 are slighty differnt gates to gate the beads, G2 and G4 are 
# slightly different gates to gate the Trucount beads
TrueC$BeadC <- ( TrueC$TC / TrueC$G2) * TrueC$G1

#import time stemp for Truecounts
FileT1 <- read.table( "FlowCytoDocs/FileT1.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")

#add time stempt to "True"
colnames( FileT1)[ 1] <- "File.Name"
TrueC <- join( TrueC, FileT1)

#replace Acquisition.Date by date from time stemp and add time column
TrueC$Acquisition.Date <- substr( TrueC$ctim, 1, 10)
TrueC$ctim <- substr( TrueC$ctim, 11, 19)

#replace Acq.Dat and ctim for 2012-09-10 
#### the documentation of why this is necessary and legit has unfortunately been lost. 
TrueC[ 22, 3] <- "2012-09-10"
TrueC[ 22, 11] <- "15:00:00"

#transform to POSIXct
TrueC$ctim <- as.POSIXct( strptime( TrueC$ctim, "%H:%M:%S"))

# import reference file ( which Truecount to which samples)
TrueRef <- read.table( "FlowCytoDocs/TrueCount Reference.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")

# add DAT column (to be mastched with Bac later)
TrueRef$DAT <- substr( TrueRef$TC.ID, 1,5)
TrueRef$DAT <- strptime( paste("2012", TrueRef$Date, sep = "/"), format = "%Y/%m/%d",tz = "GMT")
                       
# match the right True counts from TrueC to TrueRef
colnames( TrueRef)[ which( colnames( TrueRef) == "TC.ID")] <- "File.Name"
TrueRef <- join(TrueRef,TrueC)

#subset for necessary columns
TrueRef <- TrueRef[, c("Sample", "DAT", "BeadC")]

# Expand TruRef Data so that it can be matched to Bac
TrueList <- split(TrueRef, 1:nrow(TrueRef))

expFunc <- function(x) { 
  if (x$Sample == "1-24") {
    df <- data.frame(Sample = x$Sample,
                     DAT = x$DAT,
                     BeadC = x$BeadC,
                     BOT = formatC( c( 1:24), width=2, flag=0))
    return(df)
    }
  if (x$Sample == "1-48") {
    df <- data.frame(Sample = x$Sample,
                     DAT = x$DAT,
                     BeadC = x$BeadC,
                     BOT = formatC( c( 1:48), width=2, flag=0))
    return(df)
    }
  if (x$Sample == "25-48") {
    df <- data.frame(Sample = x$Sample,
                     DAT = x$DAT,
                     BeadC = x$BeadC,
                     BOT = formatC( c( 25:48), width=2, flag=0))
    return(df)
    }
  }


TrueList <- lapply(TrueList, expFunc)

TrueRefExpanded <- do.call("rbind", TrueList)

# refomrat the DAT column in Bac to match the (correct) date format in TrueRefExpanded
Bac$DAT <- strptime( paste("2012", Bac$DAT, sep = "/"), format = "%Y/%d/%m", tz = "GMT")

# join the corrected bead concentration to the Bac dataframe
Bac <- join( Bac,TrueRefExpanded)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
ggplot( Bac,  aes( x = ctim, y = G1*( min( BeadC)/BeadC), colour = Rack))+
  geom_point( size = 1) +
  facet_wrap( ~Acq.Date, scales  =  "free_x") +
  geom_smooth( method  =  "lm",  se = TRUE,  color = "black",  formula  =  y ~ x)+
  labs( title  = "standardized bead concentration over time, by day",
        y = "standardized beads",
        x = "aquisition time of sample")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")
```

As we can see from the corrected bead counts above, the uppwards trend 
disappeared. We conclude from that, that they standardization by the Trucounts^TM^
worked. 

looking at the Graph above, we can also see, that some bead counts are way below the average.
To decide wheather to exclude those points, we proceed with an outlier analysis. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
BEAD <- Bac$G1*( min( Bac$BeadC)/Bac$BeadC)

ggplot( data.frame(BEAD),  aes( x = BEAD))+
   geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 50) +  
   geom_line(aes(y = ..density.., colour = 'Empirical'), stat = 'density', linetype = "dashed") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(BEAD), sd = sd(BEAD)),
                aes(colour = 'Normal'))+
  scale_colour_manual(name = 'Density', values = c('darkred', 'darkblue')) +
  labs(title = "histogram of bead counts",
       x = "bead counts",
       y= "probablity")+
  theme_bw()
```


The distribution of the standardized bead counts looks normal, with 3 clear outliers.
Let's look at which samples these outliers represent

```{r}
W <- which( Bac$G1 <= ( mean(BEAD) - 3 * sd( BEAD)))
Bac[W, c("DAT", "Lake", "DIL", "G1", "G2", "BeadC") ]
```

For `r as.character(Bac$DAT[W[1]])` there are (almost) no bacterial counts
and no bead counts. We exclude the sample.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Bac[W[1], c("G1","G2")] <- NA
```

For `r as.character(Bac$DAT[W[2]])` both the bead count and the cell number is low.
This indicates that the flow rate was just exeptionaly low. The resulting cell number is 
`r (Bac[ W[ 2], ]$BeadC / Bac[ W[ 2], ]$G1) * Bac[ W[ 2], ]$G2`, which doesn't seem unreasonable. We keep the
sample _as is_.

For `r as.character(Bac$DAT[W[3]])` the cell counts are reasonable but the bead counts are absent.
We replace the bead count by the average bead count of the 1 previous and the 2 following samples (run closeby)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Bac$G1[ W[3] ] <- mean( Bac$G1[ c( W[3] - 1,  W[3] + 1,  W[3] + 2)])
```

the following sample is missing and replaced by NA (spourious cell counts in `$G2`)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Bac[Bac$BOT == "22" & Bac$Lake == "Delsjön" & Bac$DIL == "09" & Bac$DAT == as.POSIXct("2012-07-06", tz = "GMT"),
    c("DAT", "Lake", "DIL", "G1", "G2", "BeadC")]

Bac[ Bac$BOT == "22" & Bac$Lake == "Delsjön" & Bac$DIL == "09" & Bac$DAT == as.POSIXct("2012-07-06", tz = "GMT"), c("G1","G2")] <- NA
```

Now that the dataset is bias corrected and cleaned, we can finally calculate the cell concentration in each sample.
We will also drop all columns that are not needed for downstream analysis.

```{r}
Bac$Cells <- ( Bac$BeadC / Bac$G1) * Bac$G2
Bac <- Bac[ , c("BOT", "Lake", "DIL","DAT", "Cells")]
head(Bac, 3)
```

## plotting the growth curves

Below, we plot the growth curves (Cells/ml for each day) for each Lake.
Within each lake, I plot one growth curve per dilution. The scale of the 
y-axis is hold constant throughout the figures. The dashed lines represent the 
sampling occasions. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# sampling dates
SamplDat <- as.numeric( as.POSIXct( c("2012-06-14", "2012-06-28","2012-07-12"), tz = "GMT"))

ggplot( Bac[Bac$Lake == "Surtesjön" , ],  aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2, colour = "darkblue", shape = 3 ) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5, colour = "darkblue") +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "Surtesjön", x = "date")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, max(Bac$Cells, na.rm = T)))+
  theme_bw( )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot( Bac[Bac$Lake == "Delsjön" , ],  aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2, colour = "darkred", shape = 17) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5, colour = "darkred") +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "Delsjön", x= "date")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, max(Bac$Cells, na.rm = T)))+
  theme_bw( )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot( Bac[Bac$Lake == "Lerum" , ],  aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2, colour = "darkgreen", shape = 15 ) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5, colour = "darkgreen") +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "Lerum", x = "date")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, max(Bac$Cells, na.rm = T)))+
  theme_bw( )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot( Bac[Bac$Lake == "Botan" , ],  aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2, colour = "orange", shape = 16) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5, colour = "orange") +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "Botan", x= "date")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, max(Bac$Cells, na.rm = T)))+
  theme_bw( )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  
```

I also plot the growth curves together in one graph.
This corresponds to __Figure_S2__

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Fig_S2 <- ggplot( Bac,  aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = Lake, colour = Lake, shape = Lake)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5) +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "Figure_S2", x= "", y = "Cells/ml")+
  theme_bw( )+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("orange", "darkred", "darkgreen", "darkblue"  ))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "bottom") 

Fig_S2

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggsave("figures/Fig_S2.pdf", Fig_S2, width = 8, height = 6)
```

## calculating maximum biomass and stability

From the growth data we extract two response variable that we use as
ecosystem functions in our analysis:

+ __maximum cell yield__
+ __stability__

### maximum cell yield

we want to calculate the __maximum cell yield__ as it should be representative of 
the total amount of resources that the bacterial communities could utilize. Our 
hypotheses is that more diverse communities will reach higher maximum cell yields 
as low diverse communities as they have the ability to use a greater share of the
total available nutrients. 

In order to minimize the influence of outliers, we take the average of the 
__5 highest cell yields__ in each bottle as __maximum cell yield__


```{r}
maxBM <- ddply(Bac, .(BOT, Lake, DIL), function(x) mean( x[ with( x, order(-Cells)),][ 1:5,]$Cells))
````

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(maxBM)[ which( colnames(maxBM) == "V1")] <- "maxCells"
head(maxBM,3)
```

```{r}
write.table(maxBM, "response_var/maxBM.txt")
```


### stability

we want to calculate __stability__ as we expect that a species rich assamblage 
is more stable over time than a species poor one (portfolio effect). 

As metric of stability we use the inverse of the coefficient of variance

However, as the different dilutions start from differnt cell concentrations,
we have to exclude the re-growth phase. by doing this we define stability
as the _fluctuation of community cell yield around the mean of the stationary phase_

```{r}
Bac_stationary <- Bac[Bac$DAT > as.POSIXct("2012-06-12", tz = "GMT"),]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( Bac_stationary,aes( x = DAT, y = Cells, group = Lake, colour = Lake, shape = Lake)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5) +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "growthcurves with excluded re-growth phase", x= "", y = "Cells/ml")+
  theme_bw( )+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("orange", "darkred", "darkgreen", "darkblue"  ))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "bottom") 

```


Looking at the graph of the stationary phase abundance, we can also see that some of the 
cultures experience a long-term trend. As we are only intersted in looking how stable the
culture is around the mean, we detrend the stationary phase cell abundance. For that, we fit 
a linear model of the form `Cells/ml ~ date` to the data and calcualte the stability on the residuals.
In order to avoid negative residuals we add the mean of the cell counts.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# split into list of dataframes by BOT (bottle numbers)
Bac_stationary_list <- split(Bac_stationary, Bac_stationary$BOT)

# define funciton to extract the residuals and add the mean
ResidFunc <- function(x) {
  Resid <- residuals( lm( Cells ~ as.POSIXct(DAT), x))
  Resid <- Resid + mean( x$Cells, na.rm = T)
  x <- merge(x, data.frame(Resid), by = 0)
  return(x)
}

# apply function to all Bottles
Bac_stationary_list <- lapply(Bac_stationary_list, ResidFunc)
Bac_stationary <- do.call("rbind", Bac_stationary_list)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot( Bac_stationary,aes( x = DAT, y = Resid, group = Lake, colour = Lake, shape = Lake)) +
  labs(x = "date", y = "Cells/ml") +  
  facet_wrap( ~DIL)+
  geom_point( size = 1.2) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5) +
  geom_vline( xintercept = SamplDat, colour = "darkgrey", linetype = "dashed")+
  labs( title = "detrended growth curves", x= "", y = "Cells/ml")+
  theme_bw( )+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("orange", "darkred", "darkgreen", "darkblue"  ))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), 
        legend.position = "bottom") 
```

The detrending was sucessfull and we can now proceed to calculate Stability

first we define a function to calculate the coefficient of variance (CV)
```{r}
co.var <- function(x) sd(x, na.rm=TRUE) / mean( x, na.rm=TRUE)
```

then we calculate Stability as the inverse of the CV
```{r}
Stability <- ddply(Bac_stationary, .(BOT, Lake, DIL), function (x) 1 / co.var( x$Resid))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(Stability)[ which( colnames(Stability) == "V1")] <- "Stability"
head(Stability, 3)
```

```{r}
write.table(Stability, "response_var/Stability.txt")
```
